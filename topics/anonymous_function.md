## ðŸ“˜ What is an Anonymous Function?

In Dart, an **anonymous function** is a function **without a name**. It is often used when you need a short piece of logic, especially when working with **higher-order functions** like `map`, `where`, and `forEach`.

Dart treats functions as **first-class objects**, so you can:
- Assign functions to variables
- Pass them as arguments
- Return them from other functions

## Syntax of Anonymous Functions

### 1. Full Syntax (Function Block)

```dart
(String message) {
  print("Message: $message");
};
```

### 2. Shorthand Syntax (Arrow Function)

```dart
(String name) => print("Hello, $name!");
```

---

## Assigning to Variables

```dart
void main() {
  var greet = (String name) {
    print("Hi, $name!");
  };

  greet("Dart Learner"); // Output: Hi, Dart Learner!
}
```

## Using Anonymous Functions with List Methods

Dartâ€™s collection methods frequently use anonymous functions for inline operations:

```dart
void main() {
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

  // Double each number
  var doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2).toList();
  print(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]

  // Filter even numbers
  var even = numbers.where((n) => n.isEven).toList();
  print(even); // Output: [2, 4]

  // Print each number
  numbers.forEach((n) {
    print("Value: $n");
  });
}
```

## Why Use Anonymous Functions?

| Feature         | Benefit                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| No name needed  | Great for one-time or inline use            |
| Clear scope     | Declared where used                         |
| Compact syntax  | Ideal for short logic (especially with `=>`)|
| Flexible        | Easily passed as arguments                  |

## Challenge Task

**Write a function that takes a list of names and prints a greeting for each, using an anonymous function.**

```dart
void main() {
  List<String> names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];

  names.forEach((name) {
    print("Welcome, $name!");
  });
}
```

## FAQ

### Q: Can anonymous functions have parameters?
**Yes!** You can define parameters just like regular functions.

### Q: Can I return values from anonymous functions?
**Definitely.** Just use `return` or shorthand syntax.

### Q: Are anonymous functions reusable?
Yes, but if you reuse the logic multiple times, consider using a **named function** for clarity and maintainability.

## Summary

- Anonymous functions let you define small, temporary blocks of logic inline.
- They're extremely useful with Dart collection methods.
- Mastering them improves your ability to write expressive and concise Dart code.
